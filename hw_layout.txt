The homework is based around the notion of servers and memory management. --> build a server to store, read, and delete files according to a paging system

2 systems (not counting client code)

	Server:
		- Handle incoming requests and manage interpret what the client wants.  
		- All UI implementation is in the server code
		- Server interprets errors from paging system
		- Should not care about how paging system is implemented (Black box)
		- Thread based

	Paging System:
		- Seperate class
		- Singleton
		- Create API to handle incoming read, stores, deletes
		- Writes as little as possible to screen
		- never segfault or crash
		- test thoroughly through client code	
	

Paging System API:

	??? functions needed ???

	How do we want to implement
